# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This is my public repository for MicroMaster of Algorithms and Data Structures from edX.
It will show my progress for each courses which I took in my sparetime.

I allow public to use my work as inspiration for the education as long as it does not violate the purpose of education: "Developing your knowledge and skill."
So, please don't plagiarize it and make sure when use my work as the inspiration, code the solution in your own way.
